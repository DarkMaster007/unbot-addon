## UnBot for AzerothCore Module

A bot control plug-in modified based on the UnBot plug-in. As a supporting plug-in for the AzerothCore bot module, it is more convenient for players to control the bots.

Currently being translated by me to English if I find any non-translated stuff (not used yet).

Installation: Place folder UnBot AND YssBossLoot in the 'Interface/AddOns/' directory.
